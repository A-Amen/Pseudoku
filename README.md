# Pseudoku
A pseudo Sudoku using emoji's instead of numbers in python using the Pygame library. A very basic implementation of sudoku that doesnt use backtracking. One puzzle can have multiple solutions, but always has a guaranteed set of solutions.

Filled boxes can appear pseudo-filled with a box because of pygame limitations.

You will need the pygame library to execute main.py - https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted
